		<h1> About the game:</h1>
		<br>
		<h3> The game "Pong" has been a classic and early arcade game , only in 
		this version features a 2 player versus game, with the goal of the game 
		is for the first player to first achieve the score of 10 by scoring the 
		ball. The randomness effect is implmented in the ball itself when it
		touches a sprite, randomly picks a direction between turning 145 to 180 degrees.
		The only way you can lose the game is if you lose against your competitor,
		so practice would be useful.
		</h3>
		<br>
		<h1> Game Reflection:</h1>
		<br>
		<h3> The reason me and partner choose to make this game because we wanted
		to implment a game that was both easy and was 2-player. The inspiration 
		came from viewing other games in scratch, as there were a few 2 player pong
		games on scratch. Two of the succesful aspects of the game in my opinion
		is the aesthetics and the algorithm used in the ball. But some of the obstacles
		that we came across with the game was how to add the scoring system and 
		feedback for the ball, the way overcame this is by adding the colors on the 
		side of the game (red and blue), in order to determine whether the ball has 
		reached the opponents area and consider it a point. For the ball, the randomness
		that was added made it easier to point in the opposite direction the player
		is pointing at.
		</h3>
		<br>
		<h1> Algorithm </h1>
		<br>
		<h3> This part of algorithm comes from the ball, and contains the reponses
		for the sprites, the edge, the colors on each side of the game, pausing 
		of the game.</h3>
